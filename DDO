3. Modular Codebase Development

Tasks Performed:
	•	Developed reusable modules for critical components:
	•	databricks_cmk: Manages customer-managed encryption keys.
	•	mws_workspace: Handles workspace provisioning.
	•	Submodules include:
	•	mws_network: Creates and configures VPC, subnets, and networking components.
	•	mws_storage: Manages storage configurations for workspaces.

Closure Statement:

Modular Terraform codebase created with clear separation of concerns, improving maintainability and reuse across test, dev, and prod environments.

4. IAM and Instance Profile Configuration

Tasks Performed:
	•	Defined IAM roles and policies in iam.tf.
	•	Created instance_profile.tf to manage Databricks-compatible instance profiles.

Closure Statement:

IAM and instance profiles were successfully configured to ensure secure and compliant execution roles for Databricks clusters.

⸻

5. Databricks Workspace Provisioning Logic

Tasks Performed:
	•	Authored main.tf, outputs.tf, and variables.tf files to instantiate workspaces using the workspace module.
	•	Integrated with Terraform variables for environment-specific deployments (e.g., workspace_1 with tags).

Closure Statement:

Workspace provisioning logic successfully implemented, enabling seamless creation and customization of multiple Databricks environments via input variables.

⸻

6. PrivateLink Integration Module

Tasks Performed:
	•	Configured PrivateLink networking setup in privatelink.tf.
	•	Ensured secure access paths by linking VPC endpoints with workspace resources.

Closure Statement:

PrivateLink configuration successfully integrated into the deployment, allowing secure and private connectivity between AWS services and Databricks.

⸻

7. Unity Catalog and Metastore Assignment

Tasks Performed:
	•	Implemented metastore_assignment.tf to automate binding of Unity Catalog metastore to the provisioned workspaces.
	•	Used dynamic workspace mapping for scalable administration.

Closure Statement:

Metastore assignments configured and automated, ensuring centralized governance and compliance across all Databricks workspaces.

⸻

8. Configuration Management via tfvars

Tasks Performed:
	•	Defined workspace-specific variables and tags within terraform.tfvars.
	•	Made the setup environment-aware by leveraging input variables and dynamic references.

Closure Statement:

Configuration externalized using tfvars, enabling consistent and flexible deployments across multiple environments with minimal changes.

⸻

9. Terraform Execution Readiness

Tasks Performed:
	•	Validated all modules and configurations.
	•	Ensured each component compiles successfully under terraform validate and passes linting and formatting.

Closure Statement:

Terraform configurations are validated and execution-ready for planning and deployment using terraform plan and terraform apply.
