Databricks Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the key scenarios that impact data reliability and availability in Databricks, and provides verified disaster recovery solutions based on Databricks documentation.

⸻

1. Accidental Deletion

Accidental deletion of data in Bronze, Silver, or Gold layers can occur due to human error or automated jobs.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Enable Delta Lake Time Travel to access previous versions of the data.
	•	Set a suitable value for delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration to allow rollback within a defined window.
	•	Use Unity Catalog to enforce access controls, reducing risk of unauthorized deletions.

2. Pipeline Failure During Write

Pipeline failures can result in partial writes or corrupted data in Delta tables.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Delta Lake guarantees atomic write operations for consistent state.
	•	Use write audit logs to monitor data writes.
	•	Apply overwriteSchema with caution to avoid unintended changes.

3. Data Outage from Source System

External systems may stop sending data or may send malformed data.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Implement data quality checks to detect issues early.
	•	Configure monitoring and alerting on data streams.
	•	Use fallback mechanisms for handling malformed data.

4. Checkpoint Corruption

Structured Streaming jobs may fail to restart properly due to corrupted or missing checkpoint files.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Use persistent and version-controlled checkpoint directories.
	•	Monitor streaming job health using Databricks streaming metrics.

⸻

5. Schema Evolution Mismatch

Incompatible schema updates may lead to broken transformations and failed jobs.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Use schema enforcement to ensure data conforms to expectations.
	•	Test schema changes using Auto Loader or mergeSchema in lower environments before promotion.

⸻

6. Metadata/Table Inconsistency

Manual edits or failed operations can result in metadata that does not match actual table structures.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Use Unity Catalog for centralized and audited metadata management.
	•	Validate schema consistency using catalog APIs.

⸻

7. Expired Retention Policies

Improper retention configurations may result in permanent data loss.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Set retention values via delta.logRetentionDuration and delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration.
	•	Avoid aggressive or frequent use of VACUUM.

⸻

8. Partial Restore Failure

Data restoration from outages or reruns may be incomplete.

Recovery Measures:
	•	Use checkpointing for recovery in structured streaming jobs.
	•	Confirm successful restores using audit logs and monitoring.
