Hi Hadoop Team,
Could you please verify that the following Service Accounts (SV) have read permissions for these schemas: ucdb_tcc_mdl_prd, aws_connect_rtl, wdy, and SCN.
Here is the list of accounts by environment:
• Dev: sv-edldev1-analytics
• QA: sv-edlqas1-analytics
• TEST: sv-edltst1-analytics
• PROD: sv-edlprd1-analytics
Please let me know if any read access is missing for these accounts.
