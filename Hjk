1. Database & Table Redirection
• Environment Switch: You changed all database pointers from _prd to _sbx.
• Source Tables: You redirected the script to pull from the sandbox versions:
• ucdb_tcc_mdl_sbx.ccea_cplt_pred_calls
• ucdb_rsbb_mdl_sbx.ccea_tcc_call_reasons
• Output Table: You updated the final table name to the one you manually created and altered: ucdb_rsbb_mdl_sbx.ccea_tcc_model_cplts_daily_test1.
2. Schema Alignment
• Column Rename: In your join logic, you changed the column name from eff_dt to edl_eff_dt to match the actual schema of the ucdb_rsbb sandbox table.
• Join Logic: You ensured the SQL within the script correctly maps to the edl_eff_dt column found in ccea_tcc_call_reasons.
