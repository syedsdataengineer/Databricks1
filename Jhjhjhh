Project Updates
- Completed testing phase; ready for migration steps  
- Agreement being secured for migration plan  
- Production move expected in a couple of weeks after approval  

Migration Plan
- Goal: migrate cube and replace the eight model  
- Need to address look‑up time and variable handling during migration  
- Ensure active replication remains functional throughout transition  

Look‑up Tables & Data Handling
- Question raised: what happens when a new entry isn’t in the existing look‑up?  
- Likely outcome: entry returns blank or default value (to be confirmed)  
- Plan to review and possibly adjust look‑up logic before go‑live
