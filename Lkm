Subject: Unable to CREATE TABLE – Requesting DDL Access Clarification

Hi Team,

I’m currently assigned to the eggy-com-dev-developers group with readonly roles (APPID:203582182), and my user ID is G92162. My teammate G91403 is facing the same issue.

We’re both receiving authorization errors when attempting to run CREATE TABLE statements in DEV schemas like CCM_STG and SLCG. I’ve attached screenshots showing the exact error messages.

Could you confirm if we need to raise a request for additional DDL or write access to resolve this?

Thanks,
Syed
