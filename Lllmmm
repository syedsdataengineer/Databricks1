Hi Team,
We are currently facing multiple job failures in production that are blocking our downstream processing. Our dependent jobs are currently stuck in a "waiting" state.
Could you please investigate the root cause for the following failures?
• DTDPLCCM – Failed at step GEN 510
• (Specific failures: DTDPLCCMDATA_PRD, DTDPLCCRDATA_PRD, DTDPLCCSDATA_PRD)
• DTDPLATR – Failed at DTDPLATRDATA (GEN 1033)
• DTDPLCUB – Failed at DTDPLCUBEDATA (GEN 1159)
