Great — let’s walk through Step 3: Granting API permissions and admin consent in the Azure Portal:

⸻

Step-by-Step: Grant API Permissions + Admin Consent

1. Go to Azure Portal

Open https://portal.azure.com

2. Navigate to App Registrations
	•	In the search bar, type “App registrations”
	•	Click on “App registrations”
	•	Find and click on your app (look for the Client ID you used in Databricks)

3. Go to API Permissions
	•	In the left-hand menu, click “API permissions”

4. Add Required Permissions
	•	Click “+ Add a permission”
	•	Choose Microsoft APIs > Azure Service Management or Azure Cost Management
	•	For Azure Cost data:
	•	Choose: APIs my organization uses
	•	Search for: Microsoft.CostManagement
	•	Select it, then choose:
Delegated permissions > CostManagementQuery.Read
	•	Or for broader access, use Application permissions
	•	Click Add permissions

5. Grant Admin Consent
	•	After permissions are added, you may see a warning message under “Status” like:
“Not granted for ”
	•	Click the “Grant admin consent for ” button
	•	You need to be an admin, or ask your Azure AD admin to do this part

6. Confirm Everything
	•	The status should now say: Granted for

Optional: Permissions You Might Need

If you don’t see Microsoft.CostManagement, or it’s not working, try adding:
	•	Azure Service Management > Application permissions:
	•	user_impersonation

This is the more general way to let apps use Azure REST APIs.

Once you’ve done this, re-run your Databricks notebook — it should authenticate successfully now.

Let me know if you want to test a minimal token fetch just to confirm auth is working before running the full cost query.
