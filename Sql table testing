BASIC TEST CASES: TABLE-TO-TABLE DATA VALIDATION

Table1 = Table2 Comparison
 

Test Case 1: Row Count Match
Test ID: TC_001

Objective: Verify both tables have same number of records

Test Type: Data Validation

Priority: High

 

SQL Query:

SELECT
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table1) AS Table1_Count,
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table2) AS Table2_Count;

 

Expected Result: Both counts should be equal

Status: _________________

Comments: _________________



Test Case 2: Find Missing Records in Table2
Test ID: TC_002

Objective: Check if any records from Table1 are missing in Table2

Test Type: Data Completeness

Priority: High

 

SQL Query:

SELECT t1.ID
FROM Table1 t1
LEFT JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.ID = t2.ID
WHERE t2.ID IS NULL;

 

Expected Result: 0 rows

Status: _________________

Comments: _________________



Test Case 3: Find Extra Records in Table2
Test ID: TC_003

Objective: Check if Table2 has any extra records not in Table1

Test Type: Data Completeness

Priority: High

 

SQL Query:

SELECT t2.ID
FROM Table2 t2
LEFT JOIN Table1 t1 ON t2.ID = t1.ID
WHERE t1.ID IS NULL;

 

Expected Result: 0 rows

Status: _________________

Comments: _________________



Test Case 4: Data Mismatch Detection
Test ID: TC_004

Objective: Find records where data doesn't match between tables

Test Type: Data Accuracy

Priority: High

 

SQL Query:

SELECT t1.ID
FROM Table1 t1
INNER JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.ID = t2.ID
WHERE t1.Column1 <> t2.Column1
  OR t1.Column2 <> t2.Column2;

 

Note: Replace Column1, Column2 with actual column names from your tables

 

Expected Result: 0 rows (all data matches)

Status: _________________

Comments: _________________



Test Case 5: Complete Data Comparison
Test ID: TC_005

Objective: Find all differences between both tables

Test Type: Full Comparison

Priority: High

 

SQL Query:

SELECT * FROM Table1
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM Table2;

 

Note: This will return all rows that exist in Table1 but not in Table2

 

Expected Result: 0 rows (tables are identical)
